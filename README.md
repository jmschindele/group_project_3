<!-- **"CodeName: Relay"** will be any easy to use, project estimator, designed for freelance developers & designers. Once regeistered or logged in, users will be able to manage any number of project estimates for their clients. Once within a project, users can build custom project estimates for their clients with add/update/remove functionality. When the task list is developed, the user can assign a quoted time to complete each task and their desired rate of pay per said task. Once finalized, the factors/variables will be totalled into a super fun donut chart and an easy-to-read line-by-line estimate. From there the user can save/email/print their estimate for the client. Ideally, all aspects of this will come in an easy to use, visually stimulating, NOT overly complicated package/design. -->
